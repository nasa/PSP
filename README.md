# Core Flight System : Framework : Platform Support Package

This repository contains NASA's Platform Support Package (PSP), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This is a collection of APIs abstracting platform specific functionality to be located in the `psp` subdirectory of a cFS Mission Tree. The Core Flight System is bundled at <https://github.com/nasa/cFS>, which includes build and execution instructions.

## Version History

### Development Build: v1.5.0-rc1+dev82

- HOTFIX 20210312, updates to work with older CMake
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/268>

### Development Build: v1.5.0-rc1+dev76

- Fix #246, remove unused code.
- Fix #254, use CMake to publish interface details
- Fix #256, add PSP version API
- Fix #258, Add Testing Tools to the Security Policy
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/260>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev68

- Updates continuous integration workfow by adding static analysis with timeout and code format check. Adds status badges to ReadMe and removes old TravisCI artifacts.
- Adds CodeQL analysis to continuous integration
- Apply standard formatting to psp codebase. Only changes whitespace.
- Adds missing "+dev" to development version output
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/250>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev58

- Add `Security.md` with instructions on reporting vulnerabilities.
- Rename `UT_ClearForceFail` as `UT_ClearDefaultValue` to reflect <https://github.com/nasa/osal/issues/724>
- Remove unused elements in `CFE_PSP_ModuleType_t` enum to avoids irregular enum warning
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/243>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev50

-  Instead of accessing `OS_time_t` member values directly, use the OSAL-provided conversion and access methods. This provides independence and abstraction from the specific `OS_time_t` definition and allows OSAL to transition to a 64 bit value.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/psp/pull/240>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev46

- Add cppcheck GitHub Actions workflow file
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/234>


### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev42

- Updates the Readme for RTEMS and adds `README_RTEMS_5.txt`. The changes include removing references to the CEXP module loader, and describing the development environment setup for RTEMS 5.  
- Remove obsolete OS_TaskRegister comment.  
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/226>


### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev36

- Rename `UT_SetForceFail` to `UT_SetDefaultReturnValue` since some functions that retain more than 1 value are not necessarily failing.
- Use of the size_t type instead of uint32 in unit-tests to avoid a compiler type mismatch error on some platforms.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/221>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev30

- - Use event callback mechanism to invoke pthread_setname_np() such that the OS kernel is informed of the OSAL task name. `/proc` filesystem on Linux now has actual task name, instead of all being core-cpu1. The `pthread_setname_np` API requires `_GNU_SOURCE` to be defined when compiling - this can be local to PSP.
- Set REVISION to "99" to indicate development version
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/213>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev24

- Improves the module ID lookup when getting the CFE core text segment info. VxWorks PSP should use the real module name, not assume cfe-core.o when getting text segment info
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/209>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev19

- Use the osal_id_t typedef whenever dealing with an OSAL ID value.
- Resolves build error regarding redefinition of PPC macros in the coverage test, when building on the actual ppc/vxworks target.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/206>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev14

- Sets the stub config data spacecraft id to historical value 0x42, was 42.
- Installs unit test to target directories.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/196>

### Development Build: 1.5.0-rc1+dev6

- Adds CFE_PSP_GetProcessorName
- Removes classic make artifacts
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/190>

### Development Build: 1.4.0+dev76

- Provide a new framework and perform PSP coverage tests. New coverage test executable is built and several files within PSP are targeted.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/184>

### Development Build: 1.4.0+dev71

- Restructure code to make more amicable for rebuilding in a unit test environment. No major changes, primarily just shifting code between locations/headers to support unit testing.
-  Adds a char element `Version` to `CFE_PSP_VersionInfo_t` containing the version number expressed as a string. Defines new macros for the Build Number and the Build Baseline.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/176>

### Development Build: 1.4.14

- Changes the PSP reference to be compatible with the change in nasa/osal#449 making the BSP modules more generic and changes the name.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/175>

### Development Build: 1.4.13

- Changes the PSP reference to be compatible with the change in nasa/osal#449 making the BSP modules more generic and changes the name.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/167>

### Development Build: 1.4.12

- Replace 'OS_VolumeTable' with OS_FileSysAddFixedMap() in all PSPs.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/166>

### Development Build: 1.4.11

- Removes non-termination string warnings when building with GCC9.
- Exception handling is now implemented on POSIX. There is no longer a separate handler for SIGINT - it is now treated as an exception and goes through the normal process which ends up "restarting" CFE. On pc-linux causes the process to exit normally. There is now a mechanism to capture the CTRL+C exception code and use it during normal test cycles.
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/160>

### Development Build: 1.4.10

- Implements full-precision microsecond conversion
- See <https://github.com/nasa/PSP/pull/155>

### Development Build: 1.4.9
