 * A PSP module that instantiates an RTOS-backed OSAL timebase to provide
 * various timing services.  This in turn may be used to drive CFE TIME 1Hz
 * signal, the CFS SCH major/minor frame sync and other periodic services
 * in CFE.
 *
 * This module can be used on systems which do not have a hardware
 * source for the 1Hz signal or timing info (i.e. simulation, test
 * and debug platforms, etc).
